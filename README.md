# Test-blog---Wordpress-Based-Website
A simple, ugly blog website created on Wordpress to learn functionality of CMS and basics of PHP functions, methods, stuff etc.
It allows user to set their own navigation links, blog name, brand logo in navbar and footer, place image on main site, add single blog posts.
If you want to check website and its functionality you have to download the files and put them to themes folder in wp-content. 
I haven't install Wordpress addons to github yet.
